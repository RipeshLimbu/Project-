üçΩÔ∏è Project Overview: Single-Vendor Food Delivery System
This project is a single-vendor food delivery platform, akin to Swiggy or Zomato, but specifically for one restaurant/vendor. Users can browse food items, place orders, and make payments via Khalti. The application uses:

Frontend: React (latest) with Tailwind CSS

Backend: Django (latest)

Database: MySQL via XAMPP

Payment Gateway: Khalti

The platform is an end-to-end food e-commerce system that includes user authentication, menu management, cart, order tracking, delivery management, and secure online payments.

üß≠ Project Workflow
User Registration & Login

Users sign up and log in to the platform.

JWT tokens/session-based authentication managed via Django.

Browse Menu

Users can view categorized food items.

Each item has an image, price, description, and availability flag.

Cart & Checkout

Users add items to a cart.

Quantity can be adjusted.

At checkout, delivery address and optional instructions are submitted.

Order Placement

Order is created and stored with pending status.

Payment is initiated via Khalti API.

On success, order is confirmed and set to processing.

Admin Panel (Vendor)

Add/edit/delete food items.

Manage inventory (availability, stock).

View orders, change order status (processing, delivered, etc.)

Delivery Status

Users can track the order status in real-time (auto-refresh/polling).

Notifications (Optional)

Email/SMS notification on order confirmation and delivery.
